1. Basic Organizational Structures in Software Development

Software development teams can be arranged in different organizational structures depending on company goals, project type, and team size.

a) Functional Structure

Organization is divided based on functions (e.g., Development, Testing, Design, Deployment).

Each team works separately under its own manager.

Pros: High specialization, good for large companies.

Cons: Slow communication between teams, chances of delays.

b) Project-Based Structure

Teams are formed specifically for a project.

Each team contains developers, testers, designers, analysts, etc.

A Project Manager controls the whole project team.

Pros: Faster communication, clear responsibility.

Cons: Expensive because dedicated teams are needed.

c) Matrix Structure (Most common in IT)

Mix of functional + project-based structure.

Employees report to both: Functional Manager & Project Manager.

Example: A developer works under Coding Department + also works in Project A.

Pros: Good resource usage and flexibility.

Cons: Dual reporting can cause conflicts.
